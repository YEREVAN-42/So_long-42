# So_long-42
so_long | slucas-s Prior to starting with this project, it’s better to learn about the miniLibX, the simple graphic library that we use at 42. Luckily I have a sample project where I a talk about how it works and what it offers here: https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/miniLibX_sample  The aim of this project is to create a small 2D game where players have to pick up all collectables and go to the exit making as few moves as possible. In my case, the game is about a muscular gardener cleaning up her garden from weeds. While ¿alien? creatures stand in her way. Because they are on mars. Or something.
